        		<h1>Hi, I'm Kent.</h1>
				<p>I've been creating film & video content since age 11.

While studying creative writing at the University of Southern California, I co-wrote, produced, and directed my first feature length film, Bad is Bad. Taking advantage of local resources in my hometown of Richmond, VA, I was able to stretch my $6,000 budget to create a profitable, award-winning film with over 3 million views online.

Upon graduating USC in 2012, I immediately shot my second feature film, The Hands You Shake, funded through a successful Kickstarter campaign.

Next, I co-wrote the Page Awards semi-finalist drama pilot "Iron Joe." Then I created 8 short films in 8 months for my Youtube channel, Standard Story Company. In 2016 I directed and edited the first season of the webseries Jeff's Place.

I live in Los Angeles, where I also enjoy film photography, playing guitar, and trying to improve my awful chess rating.
