        		<h1>Hi</h1>
				<p>
My name is Kent, and I've been creating film & video content since age 11.
<br><br>
While studying creative writing at the University of Southern California, 
I co-wrote, produced, and directed my first feature length film, Bad is Bad. 
Taking advantage of local resources in my hometown of Richmond, VA, I was able 
to stretch my $6,000 budget to create a profitable, award-winning film with over 3 million views online.
<br><br>
Next, I co-wrote the Page Awards semi-finalist drama pilot "Iron Joe." 
Then I created 8 short films in 8 months for my Youtube channel, Standard Story Company. 
In 2016 I directed and edited the first season of the webseries Jeff's Place.
<br><br>
I live in Los Angeles, where I also enjoy film photography, playing guitar, 
and trying to improve my awful chess rating.
