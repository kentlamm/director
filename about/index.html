<b>My name is Kent Lamm and I'm an award-winning LA-based freelance film director and editor.</b>
<p>					
While a creative writing undergrad at the University of Southern California, 
I directed my first feature length film, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPN7UEWJ6VI&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Bad is Bad</a>. 
Made for only $6,000 in my hometown of Richmond, Virginia, the film went on to organically earn over 5 million views. 
	It was one of the first features to be shot entirely on DSLR, and distributed for free on YouTube
and Vimeo. 
<p>
	In 2019, I premiered my latest short film, Will "The Machine", which screened and won awards at film festivals around the world.
	Released online in November 2019, it reached over 1 million views in just a month.</p>
		
<p>
As an editor, I've done work for brands such as Apple, Netflix, Beats by Dre, Nickelodeon, Air Jordan, Postmates, CollegeHumor, and Propel Water.
