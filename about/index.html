					<br><br>
I'm Kent, and I've been creating film & video content since age 11.
<br><br>
<p>					
While studying creative writing at the University of Southern California, 
I directed my first feature length film, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPN7UEWJ6VI&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Bad is Bad</a>. 
Taking advantage of local resources in my hometown of Richmond, VA, I stretched 
the $6,000 budget to create a profitable, award-winning film with over 3 million views online.
It was one of the first features to be shot entirely on DSLR, and distributed for free on YouTube
and Vimeo. </p>

	
<p>
In 2013, I won a national video contest for HotSchedules, and was hired to make several more
comedic videos for their other brands.
</p>
	
<p>
In 2015, I wanted to test my limits for churning out stories, and created 
8 short films in 8 months for my Youtube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kentogp" target="_blank">
Standard Story Company</a>, while working 40hrs/week as a waiter.
</p>
		
<p>
In 2016, I directed and edited the first season of the webseries 
<a href="https://www.jeffsplaceshow.com/" target="_blank">Jeff's Place</a>, which won Best Comedic Actor (Jeff Galfer)
and Best Editor (myself) at the NY TV Festival.
</p>
	
<p>
As an editor, I've done work for brands such as Netflix, Air Jordan, Woman's Day, Peter Nappi Shoes, 5Why, etc. I love finding
	new techniques and styles in post that make videos that stand out and engage viewers.
</p>

<p>		
I live in Los Angeles, where I also enjoy film photography, guitar, chess, coffee, and dogs.
