					<br><br>
I'm Kent, and I've been creating film & video content since age 11.
<br><br>
<p>					
While a craetive writing undergrad at University of Southern California, 
I directed my first feature length film, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPN7UEWJ6VI&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Bad is Bad</a>. 
Taking advantage of local resources in my hometown of Richmond, VA, I stretched 
the $6,000 budget to create a profitable, award-winning film with over 3 million views online.
It was one of the first features to be shot entirely on DSLR, and distributed for free on YouTube
and Vimeo. </p>

	
<p>
I love working, so I've stayed busy since: 
-Another micro-budget feature in college<br>
-Won a national video contest for HotSchedules, and was hired to make several more videos for their affiliate companies<br>
-Created 8 short films in 8 months for my Youtube channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/kentogp" target="_blank">
Standard Story Company</a><br>
-Directed & edited the first season of 
<a href="https://www.jeffsplaceshow.com/" target="_blank">Jeff's Place</a>, a webseries which won Best Comedic Actor (Jeff Galfer)
and Best Editor (myself) at the NY TV Festival<br>
-And much more
</p>
	
<p>
As an editor, I've done work for brands such as Netflix, Air Jordan, Woman's Day, Peter Nappi Shoes, 5Why, etc. I love finding
	new techniques and styles in post to make videos that stand out and grab viewers.
</p>

<p>		
I live in Los Angeles, where I also enjoy film photography, guitar, chess, coffee, and dogs.
