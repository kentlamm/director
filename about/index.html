My name is Kent Lamm and I'm an award-winning LA-based freelance director and editor for film and video.
<p>					
While a creative writing undergrad at University of Southern California, 
I directed my first feature length film, 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPN7UEWJ6VI&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Bad is Bad</a>. 
Taking advantage of local resources in my hometown of Richmond, I stretched 
the $6,000 budget to create a profitable, award-winning film with over 3 million views online.
It was one of the first features to be shot entirely on DSLR, and distributed for free on YouTube
and Vimeo. </p>
		
<p>
As an editor, I've done work for brands such as Netflix, Air Jordan, Woman's Day, and more. I work
fast and smart, leaving more time for the creative discoveries that elevate a video into a one-of-a-kind experience.

	I also enjoy film photography, guitar, 
	chess, coffee, and dogs, so we can talk about one of those if you prefer.
