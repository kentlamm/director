I'm Kent, and I've been creating film & video content since age 11.<br><br>
While studying creative writing at the University of Southern California, 
I co-wrote, produced, and directed my first feature length film, Bad is Bad. 
Taking advantage of local resources in my hometown of Richmond, VA, I stretched 
my $6,000 budget to create a profitable, award-winning film with over 3 million views online.
It was one of the first features to be shot entirely on DSLR, and distributed for free on YouTube
and Vimeo.
<br><br>
In 2013 I won a national video contest for HotSchedules, and was hired to make several more
comedic videos for their other brands.
In 2015 I wanted to test my limits for churning out stories, and created 
8 short films in 8 months for my Youtube channel, Standard Story Company, while working 40hrs/week as a waiter.
In 2016 I directed and edited the first season of the webseries Jeff's Place, which won Best Comedic Actor (Jeff Galfer)
and Best Editor (myself) at the NY TV Festival.
<br><br>
As an editor, I've done work for brands such as Netflix, Air Jordan, 5Why, Woman's Day, etc.
I live in Los Angeles, where I also enjoy film photography, guitar, chess, coffee, and dogs.
